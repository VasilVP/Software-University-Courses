1. SQL is a special-purpose programming language designed 
for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS),
or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS).
Originally based upon relational algebra and tuple relational calculus, 
SQL consists of a data definition language and a data manipulation language.

2. DML - Data Manipulation Language.
A data manipulation language (DML) is a family of syntax elements 
similar to a computer programming language used for selecting, inserting, deleting and updating data in a database. 
Performing read-only queries of data is sometimes also considered a component of DML.

Data manipulation languages have their functional capability organized by the initial word in a statement, 
which is almost always a verb. In the case of SQL, these verbs are:

SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE ...
INSERT INTO ... VALUES ...
UPDATE ... SET ... WHERE ...
DELETE FROM ... WHERE ...

3. DDL - Data Definition Language.
A data definition language or data description language (DDL) is a syntax similar 
to a computer programming language for defining data structures, especially database schemas.
Many data description languages use a declarative syntax to define fields and data types. 
SQL, however, uses a collection of imperative verbs whose effect is to modify the schema 
of the database by adding, changing, or deleting definitions of tables or other objects. 
These statements can be freely mixed with other SQL statements, so the DDL is not truly a separate language.

For example, the command to create a table named employees with a few sample columns would be:

CREATE TABLE employees (
    id            INTEGER      PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name    VARCHAR(50) not null,
    last_name     VARCHAR(75) not null,
    fname         VARCHAR(50) not null,
    dateofbirth   DATE         null
);
