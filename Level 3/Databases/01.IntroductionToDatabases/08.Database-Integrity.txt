Integrity constraints ensure data integrity 
in the database tables. Enforce data rules 
which cannot be violated.

Types:
1. Primary key constraint:
Ensures that the primary key of a table has
unique value for each table row

2. Unique key constraint:
Ensures that all values in a certain column 
(or a group of columns) are unique

3.Foreign key constraint:
Ensures that the value in given column is a key from another table

4. Check constraint:
Ensures that values in a certain column meet 
some predefined condition. Example:
(hour >= 0) AND (hour < 24)
