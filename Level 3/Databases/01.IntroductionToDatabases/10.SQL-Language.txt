SQL (Structured Query Language) is a special-purpose 
programming language designed for managing data held 
in a relational database management system (RDBMS).

SQL is designed for a specific purpose: 
to query data contained in a relational database. 
SQL is a set-based, declarative programming language, 
not an imperative programming language like C or BASIC.
