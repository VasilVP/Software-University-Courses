Types of DB Models:
1. Hierarchical DB Model
2. Network Model
3. Relational Model
4. Entity-Relationship model
5. Object Model
6. Document Model
And more...

1. Hierarchical DB Model:
A Data model, in which the data is organized in a tree. 
The data is stored as records, which are connected via links.
A record is a collection of fields, with each one holding
only one value. (Corresponds to rows in RDBMS)

2. Network Model
DB Model allowing a flexible way of representing objects
and their relationships. Its schema is viewed as a graph.
While the hierarchical model allows an entity to have
only one parent and many childs, in the network model,
an entity can have many parents and many childs.

3. Relational model
In the relational model of a database, 
all data is represented in terms of tuples, 
grouped into relations.
A database organized in terms of the relational model
is a relational database.

4.Entity-Relationship model (ER Model)
a data model for describing the data
or information aspects of a business domain 
or its process requirements, in an abstract way 
that lends itself to ultimately being implemented
in a database such as a relational database.
The main components of ER models are entities (things)
and the relationships that can exist among them.

5. Object Model
A database management system in which information
is represented in the form of objects 
as used in object-oriented programming. 
Object databases are different from 
relational databases which are table-oriented.
Object-relational databases are a hybrid of both approaches.

6. Document Model
Document databases get their type information 
from the data itself, normally store all 
related information together, and allow every instance 
of data to be different from any other. 
This makes them more flexible in dealing 
with change and optional values, 
maps more easily into program objects, 
and often reduces database size. 
This makes them attractive for programming modern web applications.
