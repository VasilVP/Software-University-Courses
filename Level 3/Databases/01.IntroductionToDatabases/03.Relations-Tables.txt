A relation is defined as a set of tuples 
that have the same attributes. 
A tuple usually represents an object and information 
about that object. 
Objects are typically physical objects or concepts. 
A relation is usually described as a table, 
which is organized into rows and columns. 
All the data referenced by an attribute 
are in the same domain and conform to the same constraints.
