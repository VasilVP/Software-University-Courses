A relationship is used to specify the connection between
two tables in a DB. There are several types of relationships:
One-to-Many, Many-to-Many, One-to-One

One-to-Many - The mainly used relationship. It describes
that entity X is related to many entities (Y1, Y2, Y3...),
but entities Y1, Y2, Y3... are related to only one entity X.
An example:
A customer has many orders, but an order has only one customer.

Many-to-Many - Describes that entities x1, x2, x3... are
related to many entities y1, y2, y3 and the other way around.
This type of relationship is archieved via an intermediate
table.
Example: A student has many courses and a course has many students.

One-to-One - One entity is related to only one other entity
and the other way around. Used to model Inheritance in
DBs.
Example: A person could be a teacher and a teacher only 
and the teacher is a person and nothing else
