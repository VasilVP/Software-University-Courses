A NoSQL (often interpreted as Not only SQL) database 
provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data 
that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations 
used in relational databases.

NoSQL Types:
*Document model (e.g. MongoDB, CouchDB)
  - Set of documents, e.g. JSON strings
*Key-value model (e.g. Redis)
  - Set of key-value pairs
*Wide-column model (e.g. Cassandra)
  - Key-value model with schema
*Object model (e.g. Caché)
  - Set of OOP-style objects


NoSQL DBs Examples:
* Redis
  - Ultra-fast in-memory data structures server
* MongoDB
  - Mature and powerful JSON-document database
* CouchDB
  - JSON-based document database with REST API
* Cassandra
  - Distributed wide-column database
