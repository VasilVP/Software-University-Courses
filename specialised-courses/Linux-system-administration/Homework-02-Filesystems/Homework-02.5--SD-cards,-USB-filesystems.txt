F2FS - Flash-Friendly File System is a flash file system 
created by Kim Jaegeuk at Samsung for the Linux operating system kernel.
The motivation for F2FS was to build a file system
that from the start takes into account the characteristics
of NAND flash memory-based storage devices (such as solid-state disks, eMMC, and SD cards),
which have been widely being used in computer systems ranging from mobile devices to servers.

UBIFS - UBIFS has been merged since Linux 2.6.22 in 2008. UBIFS has been actively developed from its initial merge.
UBIFS has documentation hosted at infradead.org along with JFFS2 and MTD drivers.
Some initial comparison show UBIFS with compression faster than F2FS

JFFS / JFFS2 / YAFFS
JFFS was the first flash-specific file system for Linux, but it was quickly superseded by JFFS2, 
originally developed for NOR flash. Then YAFFS was released in 2002, dealing specifically with NAND flash, 
and JFFS2 was updated to support NAND flash too.
