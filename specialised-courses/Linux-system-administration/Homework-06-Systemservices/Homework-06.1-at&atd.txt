1. Да се опише за какво се използва командата at & daemon-а atd :)

at - Command that executes a given command on a precisely scheduled time. 
Unlike cron, it is executed only once when the time has come. 
The syntax is as follows - at (TIME) (COMMAND). Note that the time can be in
any regular datetime format.

atd - The daemon that checks the list with the at jobs periodically and 
executes them when the time comes.
